# What the Magic Ball sees

## Description

I decide to make this fun game in about a week. You put in your name and the Magic ball guess your age, gender, nationality and provide a photo. This project uses five Apis. Three to guess your age, gender and nationality. One to decode part of that to be readable and the last one to display a picture. The photo is base off what the first three apis thought of your name. 

I really like this project and hope to update it one day, maybe with AI art.
