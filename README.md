# What the Magic Ball sees

## Description

Hey there! I've got a fun game idea that I plan on creating in about a week. You simply enter your name and the Magic ball will guess your age, gender, and nationality. To add an extra layer of fun, you can even provide a photo! This project utilizes five different Apis - three of them are used to guess your age, gender, and nationality, another is used to decode some information to make it readable, and the last one is used to display a picture. The cool part is that the photo is based on what the first three APIs think of your name!

I really like this project and hope to update it one day, maybe with AI art.
